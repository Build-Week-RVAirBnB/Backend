// 1. Users can register/create an account as either an **RV Owner** or a **Landowner** (web, mobile)
// 2. **Landowners** and **RV Owners** can login to the the app. (web, mobile)
// 3. **Landowners** can create, update and delete reservations of their available land. At a minimum, a reservation must include the land's location, description, price per day, and a photo. (web, mobile)
// 4. **RV Owners** can query/filter available reservations by location (at a minimum) and reserve a spot for their RV for a desired date(s) (web, mobile)
